This mouse interface converter allows the mouse to be connected directly to PS/2 port and via an adapter to RS-232 serial port. The mouse interface converter includes a mode-detection circuit for detecting which type of port the mouse is currently being connected. The mode-detection circuit can generate a mode-indicating signal indicative of the type of the currently connected port, which is then used to set a control circuit to convert the mouse data to the corresponding format. The mouse interface converter further includes a driving circuit that allows the mouse to be more compatible with various signals of either the PS/2 port or the RS-232 serial port. This feature allows the mouse to be considerably reduced in power consumption that allows the mouse to be suitable for use on notebook computers.",
